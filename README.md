# Data Analysis with Python
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a nonprofit organization helping thousands of people learn to code for free. This respository captures my personal solutions to the data analysis with python projects.

# Projects
These projects are made for the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification. The objective was to use Python and libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in order to build five data projects that fulfill freeCodeCamp's requirements. To find further information on the projects, they are provided below.
